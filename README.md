# My-bio
My name is Cynthia. I am originally from Argentina. I've lived in the UK for nearly 19 years. I am already settled here. I first came to England to study. I studied English for two years and after that a degree in Economics at Kingston university. Unfortunately, after finishing my degree in economics in 2008 the economic crisis of 2007/8 happened. This was remarkable, it was hard to find jobs for those disciplines.

While at university I met my husband, we married and built a family quite quick.
I couldnâ€™t keep quiet ðŸ˜Šâ€¦while I was raising my family, I started an e-commerce home business. The business grew very quick, quicker than I expected, or I was prepared for. At first I thought the business would allow me to manage the time of being my own boss and work around the family responsibilities. But as good as this sounds, a start-up business demands 24/7 commitment (at least the one I was doing). 

I was forced to slow down, so I used the knowledge I had gained in a less time-consuming business (as still my family kept growing and needed me). It was then in 2017 when I started to dig more into websites developments, IT, and social media marketing, I did that as a consultant and freelancer. 

Since 2020 the family no longer needs me as before, theyâ€™re all grown and independent. So I though, ok my time has come to go back to work and catch up on my career from where I stopped but, lockdown came, together with home-schooling ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜Š so after two lockdowns I can claim to be a kind of mum qualified teacher.

And here we are now! Thankfully things keep moving forward and I believe the world and work will evolve around the changes and circumstances that presents. I am very excited about starting this career accelerator course, I truly hope nothing will stop us now to pursue those career dreams that we left on hold for a little while. ðŸ™Œ
My dream job is to work as a Data Analyst consultant for a big company or as freelancer and to help many companies to succeed in their business. I look forward to being able to combine my love for economics, statistics, forecasting with IT methodologist to help businesses improve and keep competitive in the marketplace.

I love jogging and doing sports. Favourite music Kari Jobe, Jesus Adrian Romero. I love dancing Salsa and fun music. One of my favourite books was Rich dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki.

I wish all of you the very best!

# My-bio
My name is Cynthia. I am originally from Argentina. I settled and lived in the UK for nearly 19 years and . I first came to England to study English and continued with an Economics degree.

While at university I met my husband, we married and built a family quite quick and while raising my family, I started an e-commerce home business. The business grew very quick, quicker than I expected, or I was prepared for. The business demanded 24/7 commitment (at least the one I was doing hence I was forced to slow down as my kids were still young.

I used the knowledge gained in a less time-consuming business, it was then in 2017 when I started to dig more into websites developments, IT, and social media marketing, I did that as freelancer. 

Since 2020 the family is very independent and they don't need me as before. Hopefully things keep moving forward and I believe the world and work will evolve around the changes and circumstances that presents. 

My dream job is to work as a Data Analyst consultant for a big company or as freelancer and to help many companies to succeed in their business. I look forward to being able to combine my love for economics, statistics, forecasting with IT methodologist to help businesses improve and keep competitive in the marketplace.

I love jogging and doing sports. Favourite music Kari Jobe, Jesus Adrian Romero. I like dancing salsa and fun music. One of my favourite books was Rich dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki.

All the best
